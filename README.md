**Purposive Communication || 1**

**Verbal** - Words

**Non-Verbal- G**estures, face, action



**Means of Communication** 

&nbsp;    For effective an successful communication, we use words to express ideas which can be easily understood by the person we are talking to.



&nbsp;	**Appropriateness** - Using a language that is appropriate to the environment or occasion

&nbsp;	**Brevity** - Using words that are simple yet precise and powerful

&nbsp;	**Clarity** - State message and express ideas and feeling clearly 

&nbsp;	**Ethics** - Choose words carefully and consider the gender, roles, ethnicity, preferences, and status of the person or people being talked to.

&nbsp;	**Vivid** - Use vivid and creative words to add color and spice to communication.



&nbsp;	**Non-Verbal-** Interaction where behavior is used to convey and represent meanings

&nbsp;		**Types of Non-Verbal communication :**

&nbsp;		- **Chronemics** - The use of time

**- Kinesics -** The use of body movements and gestures

&nbsp;		**- Proxemics -** The use of space

&nbsp;		- **Haptics -** The use of the sense of touch

&nbsp;		- **Paralanguage - T**he use of tone, pitch or manner of speaking

&nbsp;		- **Olfactorics -** The use of smell/ your sense of smell

&nbsp;		- **Iconics -** The use of codes and symbols

&nbsp;		- **Oculesics -** The use of eye movements

&nbsp;		**- Colorics** - The use of colors

&nbsp;		**- Objectics** - The use of objects or artifacts 

&nbsp;		**- Pictics** - The use of facial expressions



**Elements of the Communication Process:**

**1. Source/ Sender**

The one who encodes a message or information to the receiver who accepts it. You, as a sender, need to be clear about the message you want to convey. In which, you must know what exactly it is that you want to communicate. In summary, you have to know what you what to communicate and the way you want to communicate it.

&nbsp;	**2. Message** 

The message is simply the information that you want to communicate.

&nbsp;	**3. Channel**

&nbsp;		The method that you use to convey your message.

**4. Decoding**

Decoding occurs when you receive the message that has been sent, in order to give the speaker a feedback.

&nbsp;	**5. Receiver**

&nbsp;		The receiver/decoder is the person to whom you send your message. They will be the ones decoding your message.

&nbsp;	**6. Feedback** 

&nbsp;		Your decoder is expected to give a response on how they have understood the information sent either through verbal or non-verbal communication. It is essential to pay attention to this feedback in order to assess whether the message has been clearly transferred.

**7. Noise**

&nbsp;		The barrier that interferes in the communication process. There are two kinds of noise;

&nbsp;			**- Internal Noise** - Happens when something is bothering you

&nbsp;			**- External -** Interference in the surroundings. 

&nbsp;	8. **Context** 

Refers to the situation or setting in which communication takes place. There are two types of contexts;

&nbsp;			- **Physical Context -** Refers to the setting which includes location, time, weather or noise level.

&nbsp;			- **Temporal Context -** Are what people expect from a given situation based on experience.



**Models of Communication**

**Conceptual Models -** Are used to explain the human communication process with the basic concept of sending and receiving messages. 

&nbsp;	Communication Models - Are frameworks that explain how communication works.



**Aristotle's Linear Model of Communication :** 



	Speaker > Speech >      > Audience > Effect

&nbsp;			 occasion	

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	Aristotle Linear Model simply focuses on the speaker and speech and broadly divided Speaker, Speech, Occasion, Audience and Effect. Proposed in 300 B.C.



**Shannon-Weaver's Model of Communication :**



 **Info**

**Source	Transmitter	     Reception Destination**

Sender > Encoder> \[Channel] > Decoder > Receiver 

^		    noise		v

^ <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <FEEDBACK <<<<<<<<<<<<v



&nbsp;	In which the receiver plays a passive part in communication.



*Osgood and Shram??? I forgor literally*

	*Basically the field of experience. And also theres another model shown but I did not hear stuf* 



<b>Osgood and Schramms </b>Model is an improves version of communication model that shows borh sender and receiver can be the source of information and can be both receivers of information

&nbsp;	In 1954 Wilbur Shramm 1907-1987 created a model showing that both sender and receiver can both transmit and receive the message making it a cycle of communication. The idea was adapted by another theorist named Charles Egertone Osgood (1916-1991) thus the theory was termed Schramm and Osgood model of communication.



&nbsp;		**THURSDAY :** First Group Activity - Each group will prepare will prepare an oral activity that implements communication

&nbsp;			- Any topic may be chosen as long as the group implements the elements of communication process and frameworks of communication. Also has to implement non-verbal and verbal communication. Minimum of 3 minutes, maximum of 5 minutes.
